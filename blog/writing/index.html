<h1 class="title" style="margin-top: 0;">Habits for daily writing</h1>
<p class="tag">2025-04-14 · About 10 minutes long</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="context">Context</h1>
<p>I wrote this piece—like, let’s see, gosh where did I put it… ah yes here it is—on <code>2022-11-26</code>. That’s 870 days ago. For the non-walking calculators (non-calculating walkers?) among us, that’s 2 years 4 months ago.</p>
<p>I lived in Brazil for 2 years. In <em>Rio Grande do Sul</em>, what a wonderful beautiful place! Living in Brazil was a great experience, perhaps a story for another time. (One day I’ll publish that piece, I promise.) I would go into more detail about why <em>I</em> was in Brazil, of all places, but this blog is on the public internet, etc. (<em>who knows</em> who is reading this). So, until I figure out exactly what to write about Brazil, apologies for the omission.</p>
<p>I wrote <em>a lot</em> while I lived in Brazil. I think, over the course of 2 years, I wrote 300k+ words a lot (as of the last time I counted). Mainly short-form essays (like the one that follows this big context block)! The process of writing 300k words over the course of 2 years was in actuality quite interesting (or so I tell myself): In short, I kept a document called <em>Questions</em> that I added to whenever an interesting idea came to mind. Each morning, I would spend about 30 minutes to an hour trying to write “an answer” to the most interesting question (Which worked out to about 500 words per answer, give or take, though usually over 1,000. I often went over, ha.) That’s not all there is to it; I also wrote lengthy specifications for not one but two (!) new programming languages, <em>ilk</em> and <em>affetto</em> (Those two darlings will one day see the light of day, I promise), as well as a weekly newsletter for friends and family about my adventures.</p>
<p>The essay that follows is an answer to one of the first <em>Questions</em> I recorded. It was (let me check, ah here), “how can I build habits to write consistently?” At the time, I knew I wanted to write <em>daily</em>, to write about interesting and personal ideas. I also had never been a consistent writer; I wasn’t sure what the process should look like, what my goal in writing so frequently should be, and whether writing daily <em>was</em> something worth trying to do. (As opposed to, e.g., keeping a better journal.)</p>
<p>So in answering the question, I learned quite a lot. The word <em>essay</em> comes from the French “to try” (that’s English, no fair!). <em>Trying</em> is what writing is: a tool for thinking, a tool through which to try. Through writing, you make your fuzzy ideas real; they’re ugly, but they’re <em>real</em>, and concrete, and you can <em>work on them</em> and <em>shape them</em> until they’re better, digestible, and match the <em>picture</em> you were holding in your mind <em>this whole time</em>, which picture has now <em>immeasurably shifted</em> as the <em>concreteness</em> of the words on the page <em>permeate</em> your mental model of the subject, causing a temporary <em>convergence</em> of clarity and symmetry which provide the focus <em>you</em> need to figure out what “to try” to <em>think about</em> next. Wow. That was winded. I digress.</p>
<p>By writing the essay that follows, I was able to adopt quite a lot of the principles I outlined, and I begun writing daily. Above all else, the essay that follows was the spark that helped me improve drastically as a writer. This experiment, that of writing daily and maintaining a <em>Questions</em> document to do so, was worth it! I would do it again.</p>
<p>Which brings me to today. I want to do it again! I <em>really</em> want to start writing again. I want to get my ideas out there. I’m sitting on 300k words of original thought, and it is <em>killing</em> me to watch the window of relevance slip past me. I want to build habits to write consistently again. More than that, to publish consistently.</p>
<p>Below is the answer to the question, in full. I hope you enjoy it. In re-reading my past self’s answer, I hope to start writing daily, once again. It’s quite a lot; We’re headed into final season here at MIT, I have to wake up early tomorrow, and I have a midterm on Wednesday, but I think I can handle it.</p>
<p>Starting today, I hope to gradually publish the pieces I have written, starting with those I wrote over the course of my time in Brazil. I also hope to include new pieces that contextualize what I’ve written and more fully explore ideas briefly outlined.</p>
<p>This piece is nothing special. It’s more of an exercise in writing, a first stroke to build momemtum. Enjoy.</p>

<h1 id="question-how-can-i-build-habits-to-write-consistently">Question: How can I build habits to write consistently?</h1>
<p class="tag">2022-11-26 · Isaac Clayton</p>
<p>The pair of skills that will have the greatest impact on your ability to
communicate complex ideas are, above all else, the skills of <em>thinking
critically</em> and <em>writing effectively</em>. If there’s anything we learn from
our education, let it be this, as the application of these skills will
carry you through much of our professional life. Volumes have been
written about the merits of these two skills; I do not want to repeat
that argument here.</p>
<p>Instead, I would like to explicitly focus on building the skill of
effective writing. Writing is the point at which the suspended structure
of thoughts we hold in our mind become ink on a page: as writers, we
must learn how to cross this boundary as seamlessly as possible. Our
goal, after all, is to recreate our pattern of thought in the reader’s
mind—keeping her engaged—lest her eyes wander off the page and the
unfinished structure we are transmitting collapses under its own weight.</p>
<p>As writers, we have a difficult task: we must learn how to break down
and ship structures of thought across the boundary of our mind, such
that they can be reassembled incrementally, each sentence standing on
its own. Much ink has been spilled on techniques for casting ideas in
stone (‘On Writing Well’ by Zensser comes to mind); this is not that
essay.</p>
<p>Learning to write well comes with time. There is no single trick, or bag
of tricks, that can substitute for content, clarity, or style. Like
anything else in life, to truly get better at writing, you must
practice. And to practice writing, you must write consistently. That is
the theme of this essay today (betrayed by the title, I suppose): How
can we, as writers, build <em>habits</em> to write <em>consistently</em>?</p>
<p>I would like to take a second to focus on the first part of that
question, the question of building <em>habits</em>. Habits are, after all, an
action we perform habitually; without much thought to whether we do it
or not. Building habits is very, very hard: after all, they’re not
usually something we think about. To build a habit, we need to change
the way we think. Building habits requires changing patterns of thought.</p>
<p>If our goal is to write effectively, we know that there is no better
substitute for improvement than practice: consistent, <em>daily</em> writing.
While a realistic, concrete goal, it’s one that seems to be awfully hard
to attain in practice. (At least for me, that is: although I write a
lot, I rarely <em>finish</em> a single piece daily). So what’s holding us back?</p>
<p>Habits are centered around patterns of thought. It’s an age-old adage
that desires become thoughts, thoughts become actions, and actions,
well, become <em>habits</em>. We all have the <em>desire</em> to become better
writers. If your eyes haven’t yet wandered off the page by this point,
you’re probably the type to spend a lot of time thinking about writing.
Despite that, we don’t <em>actually</em> write as often as we want. So what
patterns of thought are preventing us from performing the action of
writing daily?</p>
<p>For me, at least, the days when I do not write are days when I excused
myself from the task. When confronted with the thought of, “hey, you
have the goal of learning to <em>write effectively</em>, why don’t you write
something right now?” my mind has no shortage of answers and excuses.
Exposing a few of the more common candidates, my mind often
automatically replies:</p>
<p>“I don’t have any time today, but I’ll write tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>“That sounds great, but I’m all out of great ideas. Maybe we can read
about Tropical Semirings to get some ideas!”</p>
<p>(Followed by a distinct <em>lack</em> of writing about Tropical Semirings). Or:</p>
<p>“I never finish anything. Why bother starting something new? Maybe we
can add to that 50-page essay outline we’ve been working on for months.”</p>
<p>(Spoiler Alert: that essay is a black hole of time and attention, and
will never be finished.)</p>
<p>In our quest to become masterful writers, such responses are often
discouraging. Well-intended or not, they direct mental energy away from
the task at hand, which is writing. So when we’re prompted to write
about something, there’s no excuse: Just Frickin’ Write!</p>
<p>In the interest of building the habit of writing by changing patterns of
thought, instead of being disheartened when destructive responses pop
into our minds, we must redirect our train of thought back on track.
Confronted with our above instinctive responses, we can instead chime
back:</p>
<p>“Even though we’re really busy today, we still have enough time to write
a little.”</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>“Let’s start writing a little about Tropical Semirings first; we’ll
start generating questions to write about in no time.”</p>
<p>(Note that our responses always redirect towards the actual action of
writing.) Or:</p>
<p>“How about instead, we write something small, no bigger than 200 words,
and actually <em>finish</em> it? If you still want to work on the essay, we can
quickly prune it into something smaller, then trim off a branch we can
easily finish <em>today</em>.”</p>
<p>Our goal here is not to prolong our mental exchange. Our goal is to
start writing. Despite our best efforts, our wills are weak and
context-dependent. Every second we spend locked in mental
conflict—instead of putting ink on page—is a second we leave ourselves
open to attacks from other distractions. We will lose the battle, unless
our pen physically hits the page, and words start flowing. The pen is
your most powerful weapon, even mightier than the sharp sword of reason,
so use it!</p>
<p>In our quest to communicate complex ideas with others, there are no
greater companions than those of critical thought and effective writing.
To become better at writing, we must practice: consistently writing
daily. Practice, of course, is a habit, and habits are hard to build. We
must attack the problem at the root: to build the habit of writing, just
start writing. Dissuading and distracting thoughts may pop up, trying to
pull you away from starting your work. Do not try to reason with them:
in doing so you’ll rationalize them into reasons to not write. Instead,
direct any wayward energy into the page: once you start writing, your
mind will shift gears, and it’ll be much easier to sustain your ability
to stay concentrated.</p>
<p>I write this essay as the first step in my journey to become a better
writer and thinker. I finally confronted the issue, thought about what
has worked for me in the past, and made a plan of action going forward.
If you are reading this someday, it is because the advice to myself
contained herein worked well enough for me to develop the habit of
consistent daily writing. In future essays I hope to document my system,
my process, and how it evolves over time. With my goal for finishing
something today met, however, that is a topic I must save for tomorrow.</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Just write!</p>
