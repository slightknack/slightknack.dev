<h1 class="title" style="margin-top: 0;">Building a Rust Mentality</h1>
<p class="tag">2022-07-21 · About 5 minutes long</p>
<p>What really helped me begin to <em>grok</em> how Rust really worked was working towards building an understanding of how its <em>compiler</em> works.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="sensible-restrictions">Sensible Restrictions</h1>
<p>Rust, at it’s core, is a programming language of <em>restrictions</em>. These restrictions exist for good reason. Upon encountering a restriction, however, it’s common to attempt to find the easiest work-around, rather than understanding the <em>why</em> the restriction exists in the first place.</p>
<p>Operating from the perspective of needless restrictions, Rust’s limitations become annoyances to memorize: don’t make that mutable here, box that async future there, make sure that trait is sized, <em>etc.</em>. If you take a step back, however, and look at questions surrounding the core principles of Rust—e.g. <em>‘what would it take to implement borrow checking?’</em> or <em>‘why does Rust’s async implementation require boxing so often?’</em>—you’ll soon find that a lot of these restrictions are a natural consequences of the design of the language and its compiler. I’ll give two examples of models underlying restrictions: <em>Aliasable xor Mutable data</em> (AxM) when borrow-checking, and <em>boxing Futures</em> in asynchronous contexts. I won’t be able to explain these models fully—many other guides to these princples exist elsewhere online—so here’s a brief summary:</p>
<h1 id="aliasable-xor-mutable">Aliasable xor Mutable</h1>
<p>All data in Rust is has a single <em>owner</em>. Temporary references to that data may be <em>borrowed</em> from this owner; these references must be either Aliasable xor Mutable (AxM), meaning that, at any one point in the program, there exist either <em>many shared references</em> to some data or <em>one mutable reference</em>. At the end of the day, it’s up to Rust’s borrow-checker to enforce that this is indeed the case. Since all data has only a single owner, <em>Rust is really good at modeling inductive datatypes</em>, i.e. objects that own all their children, e.g. trees. This is why cyclic objects—like graphs—are so hard to express in Rust: to realize a graph at the object level, you’d have to have nodes with multiple owners.</p>
<p>An object with multiple owners <em>violates the underlying principle</em> upon which Rust is able to <em>guarantee memory safety</em> at compile time. This is why, in the case of cyclic datastructures, <em>borrow-checking must be deferred to runtime</em>, either through the use of Interior Mutability (i.e. dynamically checking AxM rules), Arenas (another level of indirection, each object only has a single owner, the arena), <code>unsafe</code> (AxM correctness is deferred to the programmer), etc. Lifetimes and borrow-checking are hard, but by <em>building a mental model</em> of how the compiler works, it’ll be easier to <em>write code that sticks to the compiler’s strengths</em>, saving you a world of work trying to track down spurious lifetime errors.</p>
<h1 id="boxing-and-async">Boxing and Async</h1>
<p>Rust’s <em>async</em> story is similar. When you <code>.await</code> a <em>future</em>, you’re essentially <em>taking a snapshot of all temporaries</em> (think local variables) required to finish executing the current task. Rust creates an ‘invisible struct’ to store these temporary values before yielding to the executor. As different futures may have <em>differently sized</em> invisible structs, a dynamic selection of futures needs <em>further indirection</em> (e.g. <em>boxing</em>) in order to have a known size at compile-time.</p>
<p>The unknown size of futures is also why you <em>can’t use recursion inside an async function without boxing</em>. Because each recursive call grows the size of the stack, and the number of recursive calls is unknown at compile-time, it is not possible to know the size of the future at compile-time. For this reason, it is required that you box the return value when recursing in an async function, such that, from the perspective of the compiler, recursive functions <em>return values of the same size</em>. Async/Await isn’t actually that hard if you box everything (just look at JavaScript): Rust really wants to give low-level control to the end-user, providing general APIs that let you write custom executors that allow you to control how every single line of code in your codebase is fetched and executed. <em>This unyielding requirement for a leaky-but-necessary abstraction is why there appear to be so many annoying restrictions around dealing with futures in Rust.</em></p>
<h1 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h1>
<p>Of course, these examples are just simplifications of the underlying model. What’s most important is <em>expanding your underlying model when encountering novel errors</em>. Even you get an error you’re not expecting, revise your mental model, rather than special-casing the error and tucking it away in some corner of your mind. <em>Developing these models takes time</em>, but Rust isn’t going anywhere: AxM is true today, and it’ll be true 10 years from now. To design things well in Rust is to embrace the restrictions, instead of fighting them.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to design with Rust’s strengths in mind? Like most languages in the ML family, <em>Rust shines when performing a series of transformations on inductively-defined datatypes</em>. For this reason, if you cognizantly design applications <em>holistically</em> using a functional-procedural approach, the design patterns of the language will lend themselves more naturally to the task at hand. Designing applications patterned after Rust’s strengths is probably a topic worthy of a book, or at least another blog post.</p>
<p>At this point I could wax poetic and pine about the pain of the inevatability leaky abstraction. On the contrary, I think Rust does an exceptional job with respect to the quality of the abstractions it provides. Although not airtight, Rust’s abstractions aim to be zero-cost. Rust pulls no punches trying to hide how things work under the hood. <em>If it did, it wouldn’t be Rust</em>.</p>
