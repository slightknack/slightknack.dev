    "note": "I need to start a manufacturing company. Manufacturing should be cool again. I mean it is, right? Name any sci-fi future where there isn't some sort of universal assembler that fits in a box.\n\nAdvancing American manufacturing requires a few things:\n\n1.  Institutions researching advancements (check).\n2.  Groups turning advancements into products (check).\n3.  Groups turning products into manufacturing processes (no).\n4.  Groups implementing and optimizing existing manufacturing processes using advancing technology (no).\n5.  Physical factories to produce goods (so-so).\n6.  A highly trained technical manufacturing workforce (no).\n7.  An education system training such highly trained manufacturing workforce (no).\n8.  No distracting \"better capital investments\", like finance, available.\n\nIdeally 1–4 should be vertically integrated, e.g. people are expected and encouraged to research, prototype, manufacture, and scale new products, from start to finish.\n\nNew life goal unlocked: become the Manufacturing King of America. gosh that sounds silly. Anyway:\n\n- You're already a good programmer. Instead of focusing on pure software, focus on learning another 95th percentile.\n- Learn this stuff at MIT. Work on stuff like this at MIT. This of the CNC program in the 80s. What new manufacturing technologies are around the corner today?\n\nI want to be able to make a company that can build anything, vertically integrated. I know this is a big ask. But here's the idea:\n\n- A company comes in, wanting to build a product. It's a keyboard, with a novel switch type.\n- We work with them to design the manufacturing process, using existing factories to prototype\n- We work to identify inefficiencies in the manufacturing process, and figure out how to scale up processes (moving from 3d printing to injection molding, etc.)\n- We efficiently manufacture a set amount of what was requested. The company can maintain their contract, in which case we continue to scale and support the process, or not, in which case we charge a lump sum and integrate the equipment into existing prototyping and manufacturing processes.\n\nThe idea would be to make the factory of factories, as Amazon is the store of stores. You come to us with a product idea and some money, we come back with the most efficient way to make that product with that money. And the answer has to be vertically integrated on American soil.\n\nObviously the right way to start would be to get a big guaranteed contract from a company of government agency, which process utilizes a lot of technology that can be repurposed afterwards.\n\nWould like to meet this guy:\n\n> William B.

    "note": "> But what we would probably want to do in a case like this is not to recompute everything from scratch every time something in the (massively multiplayer) game changes, but to update the results incrementally as the game progresses. In a declarative query language, all the queries involved in this particular case can be updated incrementally and automatically by a reasonably sophisticated query engine (or by code generated under the hood by a reasonably sophisticated compiler) without any extra effort on the part of the developer. But in an imperative (or functional) one, incrementally recomputing the output map is significantly more complex than computing it from scratch, and a lot more error-prone. That's because there's a lot of factors than can change the results, all of which have to be accounted for. [...] All of these changes have to propagated to all pieces of information that depend on them, and the exact propagation paths are different in each case.\n\nThis seems to be scratching at such a deeper idea. Gosh. I can't help but think about Witten's Live. Live can be used to write a functional transformation, and efficiently incrementally update the evaluation of that function when inputs change. Is an interpreter over declarative relations like the same thing as reactive programming?\n\nOh my gosh I read like 3 paragraphs further and now he's talking about reactive programming.",

Like a contact book, people can assign a local human-meaningful name to an ID. They can also choose to share a network name for that resource with their contacts. When a name is encountered, we first try displaying a local name (\"Jane\"), then a network name \"Alyssa → Mom\", then the name suggested by the originator of the ID, with a way to mark that it is untrusted (\"??? Dr. Jane\").",
