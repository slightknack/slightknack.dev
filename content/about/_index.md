# Who am I?

My name's Isaac, nice to meet you!

Professionally, I've been a Software Engineer at [Zed](https://zed.dev) (current) and [Tonari](https://tonari.no), as well as an [Apprentice Cheesemaker](https://hebervalleyartisancheese.com). I discovered the joy of programming when I was very young; this little hobby quickly grew to underpin the way I think about hard problems. I'm best known for my work on the [Passerine](https://passerine.io) programming language, but this is really just one facet of the type of work I find interesting.

I'm most interested in using computational systems as a foundation for building novel tools for creation and collaboration. For this reason, Iâ€™m most interested in problems at the intersection between humans, computers, art, and language.

If you want to get in touch, you can email me at `hello` at this domain; elsewhere, I'm `slightknack`. Contrary to popular belief, I am not a robot.

# About this Website?

Isaac's Website (aka [`slightknack.dev`](https://slightknack.dev)) is a random web of thoughts. Loosely technical but with no common theme, it's really just a place to link against ideas I'd like to share with others.

> Editor's Note: Man, some of these posts need some serious love.

The [current incarnation](https://github.com/slightknack/slightknack.dev) of this website is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.io). This website _used_ to run on a custom git-like database I wrote, hosted via Cloudflare Workers, with a little CMS for writing new posts in-browser. Although fun, I was getting tired of paying hosting for a website that doesn't get a whole lot of traffic. If you'd like a little blast-from-the-past, here's a [mirror](https://website.slightknack.workers.dev/home).

There is an [RSS/Atom feed](https://slightknack.dev/atom.xml) for those of you who use newsreaders. For those of you who do not, just bookmark this site or check back for new posts occasionally, I guess.
