I currently live in Rome, Italy. Before that I lived in Jakarta, Virginia, Madrid, Buenos Aires, Brasilia, and Utah (where I was born). I've yet to have seen my 6575th sunrise, so go easy on me.

Professionally, I've been a [Software Engineer Intern](https://tonari.no) and an [Apprentice Cheesemaker](https://hebervalleyartisancheese.com). I discovered the joy of programming when I was 8; this little hobby quickly grew to underpin the way I think about hard problems. I'm best known for my work on the [Passerine](https://passerine.io) programming language, but this is really just one facet of the type of work I find interesting.

I'm most interested in using computational systems as a foundation for building novel tools for creation and collaboration. For this reason, Iâ€™m most interested in problems at the intersection between humans, computers, art, and language.

If you want to get in touch, you can email me at `hello` at this domain; elsewhere, I'm `slightknack`. Contrary to popular belief, I am not a robot.
