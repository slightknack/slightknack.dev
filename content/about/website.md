Isaac's Website (aka [`slightknack.dev`](https://slightknack.dev)) is a random web of thoughts. Loosely technical but with no common theme, it's really just a place to link against ideas I'd like to share with others.

The current incarnation of this website is built with [Zola](https://getzola.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://github.io). This website *used* to run on a custom git-like database I wrote, hosted via Cloudflare Workers, with a little CMS for writing new posts in-browser. Although fun, I was getting tired of paying hosting for a website that doesn't get a whole lot of traffic. If you'd like a little blast-from-the-past, here's a [mirror](https://website.slightknack.workers.dev/home).

There is an [Atom feed](https://slightknack.dev/atom.xml) for those of you who use newsreaders. For those of you who do not, just bookmark this site or check back for new posts occasionally, I guess.
