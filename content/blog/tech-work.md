This summer I got a job. Ok, I know this isn't altogether that surprising... but, given that summer's now over, I thought it would be nice to write a little reflection about the process. This was the second job I've ever held: my first job was working as an apprentice cheesemaker the summer before, but that's a story for another time.

For those new to this blog, welcome! I'm Isaac, a 17-year-old from Utah living in Rome. I usually write about things that are loosely programming related, like language design and distributed systems.

Last summer I worked at [*Tonari*](https://tonari.no), a Japanese startup developing floor-to-ceiling portals to connect two spaces. This job was *very* different from my first, in just about every way; aside from being intellectual, as opposed to physical, labor, it was also my first remote job and my first time working in a research role for a tech company.

# Why?
I'm primarily writing this guide for two reasons. First, when applying to jobs in the future, I think it would be nice to have a little reference as to what works and what doesn't. Second, I hope this guide serves as a source of inspiration for other young people who want to work in tech but aren't quite sure how to get started or what to expect out of the experience.

# Application process
Before I got a job, I needed a list of companies to apply to. I wasn't really sure who to apply to, but given the nature of the pandemic and the fact that I probably can't travel for work, I compiled a list of small-to-medium-sized companies that were working with tools and technologies I was interested in pursuing. Gitlab, Stripe, Ghost, Unison, and of course Tonari were all companies I applied to.

A lot of companies didn't have internship positions opens, so I applied for entry-level positions and indicated that I was interested in pursuing an internship. Of the 16 companies I applied to, I received 7 rejections and 4 responses; the other 6 companies still haven't gotten back to me (and probably never will).

Here's the list of positions I applied to and the outcome of each interaction; I think I got better at writing applications over time:

<img alt="A table of the positions I applied to and the outcome of each application" src="/content/jobs.png" style="max-height: 70vh;">

From what I've read about software hiring processes, this table is either highly standard or highly abnormal, considering my circumstance. With this in mind, what was completing each application like?

## Résumé Writing
I'm pretty sure I sent out the initial applications to these jobs over the course of two days. I wrote my resume the first day and sent out two applications, then sent out 14 applications the next. I was planning to send out more, but I lost some steam after the initial wave of rejection letters.

Given that I'm still in high school, and my previous job was working at a dairy, I wasn't entirely sure what to put on my résumé. I decided that I wanted to emphasize [my work in Open Source](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine) and my academic experience, and I put those sections at the top.

I didn't use a résumé template, but instead used good ol' Google Docs with lots of tables for arranging things on the page. Not sure if this is how I'd approach writing a résumé in the future, but it this technique was quick and almost looks half-professional:

![My résumé, with some personal information greyed out](/content/old-resume.png)

I'm not sure how appropriate emojis are in résumés (probably not appropriate at all), but I didn't have time to whip out Figma to design custom icons. (Using `🐙` to symbolize GitHub is *probably* stretching it a bit, though).

Some jobs also required a cover letter, which I styled in the same manner as my résumé. Each job had slightly different requirements, so I'd swap some things out here and there to more closely match the job description; apparently, there are online tools that will do this whole process for you, but I just tweaked by hand because why not. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

So yeah, that's my résumé. I guess now I have to live with being eternally embarrassed for miscapitalizing 'pH'.

## Responding to application questions
My parents had given me the green light to get a job, but left it up to me as to which companies I wanted to apply to and how to approach the application process. I don't think they fully realized the scope of what I was doing, though, until I took over the kitchen for a few interviews.

Before we jump into interviews, though, I'd best discuss what filling out the applications themselves was like.

I tried to apply to jobs directly through the company's job application form or through email; I figured if I did it this way instead of using a job marketplace, I'd be able to more accurately articulate my present situation in hope of garnering a response. Entering the same information over and over again was a bit rote and tedious, but such are the ways doing any hard thing.

After this, most job applications had one or two short-answer response questions in the vein of:

1. Who are you and what are you looking for in this role?
2. What are your thoughts on Open Source?
3. Why does this company grab your attention?

I'm not the best writer out there (not by a long shot, ha!), but I can type fairly quickly (~88 WPM) and tend to type things out right the first time (even if they're overly long or prosaic).

For each of these questions, I usually started by giving a short answer to the question. I'd then explain who I was, and that I was looking for an internship position instead of whatever position I was actually applying. If you're curious as to what these responses looked like, here are a few excerpts:
