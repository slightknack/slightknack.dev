I've been *Sketchnoting* on the daily for over 1,400 days. This is a staggering amount of time for me — almost a quarter of my life, given that I'm only 17 — so I thought it would be appropriate to reflect and record some of my thoughts on the subject.

![image](or something)

I hope that this post convinces people of the power of paper notes in an increasingly digital world, and serves as a practical guide for those interested in learning how to take better more visual notes.

This post will be a bit of a departure from the rest of the posts of this blog; aside from covering non-technical subject matter, it will be a bit of a longer than usual. Buckle up, grab a snack, notebook, and your favorite gel-ink pen. Let's get started!

- Perspective of this article
  - Target audience: people interested in note-taking
  - Purpose: Showing people the power of paper notes in a world digital notes, showing off my notes, and giving some tips for people interested in getting started

- What is Sketchnoting?
  - It's an 'art-form' that improves recall
  - Use of hand-drawn type, diagrams, and
sketchnoting
  - Sketch + Note
    - Value of visual note-taking strategies
  - Sketchnotebook
    - Collection of sketchnotes organized by time. The notes themselves are as important as the surrounding visual context in which they are recorded.

- Why did I get started
  - Uncle is professor of Sketchnoting
  - Have always liked drawing
  - Going into high school
    - Always told that 'it would get a lot harder, a lot quicker'
    - Wanted to be prepared, and have the tools available to deal with it
    - Still haven't encountered a massive difficulty spike, and I'm taking some pretty tough classes, so I must be doing something right?

- What experience do I have with it?
  - 4 notebooks, 40 pens and markers, over 400 pages of hand-drawn notes
  - From high school:
    - 2 from freshman year,
    - 1 for sophomore and junior
    - 1 for senior, which I'm working on now.
  - It's insane to see the amount I have improved
    - I didn't start out magically gifted, early notes were:
      - too text heavy
      - spaced poorly
      - captured the wrong information
    - I've gotten better at correcting these errors, but there's still a way to go.
  - Mostly sketchnoting classes, lectures, and reading notes, which is what I've gotten good at. Skill is widely applicable, this is just the perspective I've been approaching it from this angle.

- Benefits
  - Notes are much shorter and concise than other students' notes. Stuff that normally takes 5 pages can be written in 1, and I don't have to open my notebook to remember what I've written (less braggy)
  - More engaged during class.
  - Because there's a focus on distilling information for recall (next section), I haven't needed to study for tests, or review outside of class - helps things 'just stick.'
  - Everybody loves them, especially if you include something they contributed while taking them.
  - As you get better at taking notes, you get better at *listening*. This is a tricky word:
    - Listening is physically taking in the subject, either by ear or by eye, and consolidating an understanding of the subject at hand.
    - Mapping this consolidated idea to paper is the core idea of taking good notes. Recall over reference.

- Where to learn how to sketchnote
  - This is just what I've learned, and a showcase of some of my work
  - Much better guides are available online or in print

# What is the point of taking notes?

- Why take notes?
  - Most would say for reference
  - For engagement & recall <- most important
  - Why is this the most important?
    - Paper notes are for distilling a deeper understanding, not rote memorization. Use the right tool for the job. If you need to memorize, use Anki.
    If you want to cultivate a deep understanding, tools like Notion, obsidian, etc. won't cut it. Plain Text is IMO too linear and limited a form of expression — you have to actually read it
      - Obsidian is useful, but it's more for making existing knowledge explicit, and offloading connections to make room for others. This isn't a bad thing, but it's orthogonal to the purpose of sketchnoting

The purpose of sketchnoting is to distill ideas being communicated to a dense visual representation. This representation should help you, personally, recall what's has been communicated.

The purpose of sketchnoting is to distill an idea being communicated to a personally-meaningful visual representation that triggers a deep recall of the idea being communicated.

It's `macroexpand` for the brain.

- How to take good notes:
  - Goal is to distill information to a form that promotes recall.
  - Roughly three step process:
    1. Listening actively to build an understanding
      - Focus on big idea, supporting examples
    2. Figuring out how to spatially represent that on the page
      - How to visually represent abstract and concrete ideas.
      - Use words sparingly - when to use?
      - Time is moving forward - when to record?
    3. Physically recording your understanding
      - How to draw what you're imaging
      - Technique of writing, lettering, calligraphy
      - How to utilize space, knowing how 'big words' are.
  - What good notes enable:
    - You now have a better understanding
    - You now have a condensed representation of that understanding
    - You have gotten better at creating such understandings.

# The Verbal, the written and the Visual

- When it works best
  - Visual / verbal presentation, i.e. lectures, etc.

- Why Sketchnoting is super effective
  - Engages different parts of the brain
  - Learn how to take better notes as you take them
  - Laying out information in 2d space

- Why I find it to be better than digital notes
  - Notion
  - Anki
  - Obsidian

# How to take good sketchnotes

Materials aren't important if you're just starting out - just get started already!

- Materials
  - A5 notebook
    - blank!
    - Amazon Basics
    - Moleskin
    - Doesn't really matter
  - Black markers, different weights
    - Sharpie
    - Micron
    - Pilot G2
  - Highlighter / marker, medium intensity
    - Highlighter
    - Brush
    - Normal Marker

- Getting ready
  - The heading
    - Title and lettering
  - Blocking out time
  - Preparing structure beforehand

- Taking notes well
  - Distilling main ideas
  - Illustrating different points
  - Using text sparingly
  - Polishing later

- Practice
  - Always practicing! Try to do it daily
  - Need inspiration:
    - Podcasts - I recommend Feynman's lectures on physics
    - Video essays on YouTube
    - Technical articles you want to internalize
  - Need technique:
    - Look up examples of sketchnotes online.
    - Try to copy techniques you like (it's not stealing!)
    - Don't get discouraged by the disparity. Recognizing that there is a disparity is the best way to figure out how you need to improve.
    - Take risks! A Sketchnotebook is something living. Don't be afraid to try out drastic risks that may or may not turn out. Experiment with different heading fonts, drawing styles, layout patterns, etc.
  - When to use:
    - when **listening**
    - Listening to talks at conferences
    - Listening to lectures on different subjects
    - Reviewing and condensing material:
      - good notes are about recall, not reference
    - Attending meetings where you're mostly listening
  - When not to use:
    - When you're leading or presenting
    - When you're doing rote practice work
  - Sketchnoting keeps you engaged, and they're great even if non-strictly-listening roles:
    - Can help you recall questions for later asking:
      - Can even write question and leave space for response when you ask later
    - Flipping through a few pages that you take over the course of an hour really brings that hour back to your mind.
      - Looking at one main idea triggers recall, you remember when why and where you were taking notes

# Pitfalls

- Pacing
  - If talk moving too quickly, start drawings, leave space, move on
  - If talk moving too slowly, color / repass previous sections
  - Know when to stop
  - Don't worry about going to the next page, or filling space
    - Whitespace is your friend

- Examples and exercises
  - Don't use notebook for scratch-work! keep a spare pen and loose paper to work out equations, etc. Include the best and most representative example
  - Don't record everything presented. If there's a slide, paraphrase - and remember, a picture is worth a thousand words.

- Messing up
  - You will make mistakes
  - Common mistakes
    - Misspellings
      - Small, just skip. Adds character
      - Whiteout - don't really like it
      - Correction in-place
      - Straight cross through
        - With thick marker to hide
      - Do not scribble out
    - Tilted words
      - Drawing to break of rhythm of text
      - Write lines and focus on spacing to top or bottom of page
      - Don't stay tilted, correct asap
    - Spacing
      - Don't crowd lines. Leave more space than you think necessary between things

- Separating notes
  - I like to keep everything in one notebook, but you can have different notebooks for different subjects. Note that sketchnotes are meant to be information-dense - Instead of having a notebook per subject, stick to maybe 2 or 3 at most and group by subject group (i.e. science & tech, liberal arts, personal notes). Up to you, no hard and fast rules.
  - Start each notes on a new page, trust me. Don't worry if pages are mostly blank, and don't worry about filling pages
  - Use a different color between sequential notes. Don't have to keep colors consistent between subjects, organization is up to you.

- Finding notes
  - Instead of thinking of specific topic, think about when you took the notes. As you develop your sketchnotebook, it will develop a 'feel,' different sections having different styles. Remember the feel of the notes.
  - Goal isn't to use notes for reference. Trying to visualize the layout of the notes you are trying to remember can be enough to recall the idea

# What I've learned

- Notes are more about recall than about reference. Use the right tool for the job.
- Be sure to pace yourself, space your notes. Do not be afraid of imperfection, just keep writing.
- You do not have to be an artist. You will draw things that don't look right. That is how you improve.

- Note taking doesn't have to rote and boring. It can be fun, and turn an otherwise boring lecture or meeting into something engaging; and it can turn an enlightening lecture into a discovery you'll easily remember and recall. It's also an excuse to draw during class.

- Sketchnotes aren't the end-all. Just another tool in the tool box. The final result doesn't always matter; it's learning the craft of building understandings that really counts.
