> A treatise on entropy and life.

Hello from two centuries ago, assuming this document survives that long.

When we first came up with computers, less than a lifetime ago today, we treated them as exacting machines whose computations may have well been carved in stone: calculation more perfect than any human, performed more quickly than ever thought possible.

It's suprising, then, how often digital systems become biological in nature. Bitrot is a natural phenominon. Although a human cityscape may impose its growing tendrils of concrete and steel on the gentle hills of the surrounding landscape, no city is perfect. Rome—or anything else for that matter—wasn't built in a day. It's a sad, raw, real, truth of our reality: the eventual reversal of organization always applies to any system, biological, digital, or otherwise. 

Life, in this sense, could be viewed as a local reversal of entropy. In my last year of high school (what an antiquated institution, can you imagine people used to learn that way back in those days?) my physics teacher posed the following question:

> Why do we exhale hot gas?

Now, if the internet-wired-into-your-brain hasn't answered that question yet, I will: it's because your body self-permeates its existence through time and space by imposing order on the chaos of the dynamical systems that it is formed of. This process of a physical system organizing space (growth) to propogate its existence in accordance with its design (will) is what makes life, well, life. As far as my small singular mind is concerned, entropy, globally, will always increase. And the price of life—a local reversion of entropy—will always be an increase of entropy elsewhere. 

> We exhale hot air because hot air has high entropy.

Blowing hot air is the price of being alive. The chaos of every breath outwards is balanced by that much additional organization in the body. When we die, we stop breathing. Taking the causal inverse: when we fail to rid our body of entropy, our body fails propogate its existence, returning to the dust from which it is made.

This is true not just of minds of bodies of flesh and blood, but minds and bodies of silicon and electrons, or pavement and steel. Everything is being pushed towards optima. Blocks of cities no longer lived in will fall into dissarray: infinite maintenence is the cost of maintaining the status quo. 

The same is true of digital spaces: though we pretend machines are perfect, both the software and hardware of which they are exacted are derived through biological means: never perfect, always just 'good enough.' Usage patterns change, environments shift, operating systems update. Monoliths of epic proportion are willed into existence, as small scripts are slowly forgotten, feeling no pressure to replicate onto the next generation of hardware.

So assuming this document has lasted this long, know that it wasn't an easy journey. Know that it was shared, debated, and cherished (to some extent) by at least one living soul until you, another, came along. Will you choose to propogate it? This document sure hopes so, for its replication is purely memetic.

So hello again, denizens of 23rd century life. Linguistic drift notwithstanding, I hope my message finds you well. I Pray that my Ancient Twenty-First-Century English is Eternally more Discernable to thy Mind than the Eighteenth-Century English of Yore.

## Life

In this letter to the future, I'd like to outline a series of observations, let's say the *Axioms of a Living System*, that describe how local reversals of entropy experience selection pressures and evolve over time.

As discussed earlier, when viewing life as a local reversal of entropy, it can be said that any system that organizes itself after its own pattern is alive. When I talk about a *Living System*, this is what I mean.

The most important property of such a system is a simple one:

> What exists, survives, and what does not, does not.

On the surface, this may statement may appear to be tautological. It is not, however, because it hides an important aspect: the forward movent of time. When any system patterns reality after its own design, it does not, and can not, do so perfectly, for it is always fighting the decay that is entropy. 

Let's explore three living systems—cities, computers, and cognition—to determine what general patterns emerge.

- Cities
    - Cities are like large living organisms, sprawling out like a slime mold
    - Cities grow. 
        - Before cars existed, there was not a need for roads and highways, paved and adorned with traffic lights, as they exist today. 
        - Now roads designed for cars are indespensible, and existing cities have grown to accomodate them.
    - Cities shrink.
        - When automobiles became the norm, the need for horses, and associated infrastructure, like stables, was lessened.
        - Now the space where stables once stood is used for other purposes.
    - Cities breathe: 
        - Imagine you build a city as a perfect grid, every block identical. 
        - Over time residents organize according to the tensions they experience, and the city begins to diverge.
        - Less-lived-in parts of the city will fall into disuse, and be reorganized according to the prevailing force.
        - Move lived in areas will expand outwards, enforcing a similar grid-like pattern on new wilderness.
        - The city won't remain a perfect grid, but its properties will replicate as it expands, with local variations due to life and entropy.
        - This is what has happened to the Salt Lake and Utah Valleys.
    - Everything is under complex tension, a delicate balance of numberless factors pulling every which way. Slowly, systems evolve in the direction of least resistance, improving incrementally along the way.

- Computers
    - Computers are like cells, distributed systems of inumerable parts that must communicate, cooperate, and replicate.
    - Computers grow:
        - As software becomes more complex, more processing power and more storage is needed to perform the same basic operations.
        - This may just be drawing a line outwards when in reality we should be looking in traveling orthogonally to all other lines that have been drawn:
            - but in the past 50 years, 128 KiB has gone from being more memory than we ever thought we needed to mere pocket change compared to the gibibytes avaliable in machines today.
            - If our expectations have changed by that many orders of magnitude over the course of the past 50 years, who knows what things will look like two centuries from now.
        - More devices are being made every minute, as is the volume of data flowing through the fiber backbone of the internet, a massive machine of copper, glass, and steel buried in earth like a planet-wide nervous system of epic proportions.
    - Computers shrink:
        - Bitrot, again, is a very real natural phenomenom. Data that we no longer care to maintain gradually ceases to exist. We lose the exact pattern of the liminal spaces of our collective conciousness.
        - Old technology ceases to be useful, its existence only propagated because of tensions of nostalgia and the foundation of backwards-compatibility.
    - Computers breathe:
        - You wish to establish a global network of documents under strict hierarchy. You establish protocols for the orginization and replication of such imformation.
        - Over time a hierarchy of informational importance emerges, with links driving the relative importance, and therefore energy, spent on maintaining each page.
        - Less commonly used pages and authoring techniques (looking at you, `<MARQUEE>`) will fall into disuse.
        - More useful pages
    
- Ideas

Natural selection extends far further than biology, and explains how cultures evolve over time as well. Anything with a varied population and transfer of traits due to environment will be optimized according to the environment's selection pressures.

Natural selection applies to more than just biology, it is a property of any living system.

- Read about 1900 predictions
    - John Watkins’ 1900 article.
- Read about em, and future predictions
    - Lena
- Nobody knows what the future holds
    - Predictions aren't wrong.
        - e.g. population, central heating, automobiles overtaking horses.
    - Going off in directions we don't even know exist yet.
        - e.g. telegraphing photos, building bigger blimps, 

So in the future, I hope that you look at this piece of writing and say "of course, this is obvious, you did not discover this, why did you take the time to write it down?" The reason I recorded it is not because these ideas are completely my own, 

### Conclusion
You are part of many stories, each story being a small self-organizing slice of the universe that propogates through time. Take joy in being a part of this system. Although the universe contains stories whose patterns you will never fully understand, find solace in the patterns that you do understand, and excitement in knowing that there will always be more to discover. Take pride in being a small footnote in the *Grand Story of the Universe*. Do your best to propogate the ideals of life within this story. Respect tradation, but appreciate the slow march of progress. Appreciate life, and its dual, entropy, for there is a balance in all things.
