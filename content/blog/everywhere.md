There are some questions that are hard to know to ask.

While walking or driving around a city, you may notice that some concrete columns (supporting, say, an overpass) appear to have been (retroactively?) rounded. Why? Most usually, this rounding is so the columns remain standing during earthquakes. This process of rounding is known as “concrete burst protection”. Regular concrete columns are wrapped with steel plates and the gaps are infilled. Concrete burst protection prevents, well, the concrete from bursting out and the internal rebar from collapsing during an earthquake. If you were to walk around a city and see one of these rounded columns, it would be hard to notice, or think to ask for what reason or by which process they are rounded. Even if you did notice, "the rounded-ness of concrete columns" is a hard question to answer by poking around online (how do you find the name for something you do not know the name for?), or by soliciting opinions from random non-experts.

People who are experts in a particular subject perceive these little details all the time, and deeply understand how they fit together. For example, I can look at a website or an app and tell how it was probably put together. When something doesn't work according to the model I have, my mind pins down the behavior as a bug, and I can generally work out why it happened. Whereas a lay person would probably not notice the issue, habitually work around it, or just think the app is slow or weird or broken, or they are offline. (It is crazy how many times I have seen someone say that they must be offline because an app is broken, even when they have a perfectly good internet connection.)

This “expert attention to detail” probably extends to all aspects of life. A geologist can't help but classifying the rocks and formations he sees while hiking; an ecologist fixates on specific trees, plants, animals, and the micro-ecosystems they form; the computer scientist would note the fractal-like beauty of nature across various scales and think about generation rules for stems and trunks and leaves. And even if the computer scientist is aware that there are interesting rock formations, he couldn't tell you what they are, visualize how they came to be, determine their composition, or detect, really, anything that would be unexpectedly surprising to the expert geologist. (Surprising, not exciting. Little examples of things I have seen excite me all the time!)

I want to learn how to elicit these types of observations from people, and become more knowledgeable in a diverse subject matter to form such observations myself. Despite my knowledge of technology, I rarely share such observations with others, because I operate with the implicit assumption that everyone knows how technology works and what UX decisions the developer has likely made. Just as any geologist can tell quartz monzonite from granite, or as any seismic engineer can distinguish between standard structural elements and those specifically for seismic reinforcement. But when you have gained an expert understanding of some particular detail, you wonder how you ever lived before you knew that fact, because you start seeing it everywhere.
