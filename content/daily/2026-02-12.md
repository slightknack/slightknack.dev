I had two assignments due today, and working on those consumed most of my time, so unfortunately today's post will be rather short. 

One iconic quote from a classmate in my mathematics/philosophy class today (`24.118`):

> “So... mathematics is the art of making stuff up, and then justifying it with made up notation?”

(TIL: There's a whole branch of philosophy dedicated to determine whether numbers exist, and the extent to which you can derive meaning from manipulating them.)

I also read a lot today, specifically about the history of legislation surrounding [47 U.S.C. §223](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/223) and [§230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230). I also ran into this [EFF Effector from 1995](https://www.eff.org/effector/8/14), which provides some context/commentary, along with this funny [essay about flags](https://time.com/archive/6727584/my-flag-your-shorts/).

> "But our culture is in truly bad shape if we have come to define respecting something as the failure to set it on fire."

Well, tomorrow I should have some more time. In lieu of a full post today, here's a fun math-related post. Are types a property of terms, or just annotations?
