I really like CodePen, for sketching little UI trinkets. Recently I've been thinking about design a bit more, and specifically the [Frutgier Aero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frutiger_Aero) aesthetic of my youth. I wanted to write a little html trinket editor with a minimal aesthetic, packaged as a single static html file, that I could deploy either on this site or another I run.

I had a few simple goals:

- Outside of [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) for code editing, I did not want to use any external libraries for e.g. UI. No react, no preact, no nothing. As you can tell by the way this website is built, that's the way I like it.

- Try to keep things declarative where possible. I want to avoid writing [delta code](https://acko.net/blog/climbing-mt-effect/).

- Since the UX of a tool like codepen is a solved problem, [do not write any bugs](https://matklad.github.io/2025/09/04/look-for-bugs.html); make sure the software is perfect.

For your enjoyment, here is the final result, accessible at [pen.isaac.sh](https://pen.isaac.sh)

- first approach mutable based on detlas
- second approach, constraint solving
- third and final approach, pure function
