Today is Sunday, the day of rest. My day today was very good. (My goodness it's so nice to be back home in Cambridge, MA.) I was debating whether or not to post anything today, but I figured that as I've been going strong for 2 days, I might as well keep it up.

> *N.B.* If you read this blog over RSS, and you're seeing all these posts and are worried it might be a little much, please let me know and I'll move these daily entries to a separate feed. (You can get in touch with me via the email on my [about](/about) page.)

Anyway, classes start tomorrow. In typical MIT fashion I registered for 12 classes and now have to trim down to a subset of 4 or 5. I'm most excited about *Inference and Information*, though. (The smartest guy I know told me it's the hardest class he's taken. So I might be cooked! We'll see.)

Also it's absolutely frigid! I forgot that the temperature could get this low! (While I'm frozen here, enjoy this view from the flight back.)
