Passerine is a programming language I worked on in high school, in the vein of OCaml and Scheme. This is a little blog with some notes on language design and compiler implementation. If you're a fan of macros, continuations, and type theory, you might enjoy some of these posts. If you're curious, you can also visit the [website](https://passerine.io), or check out [Passerine on GitHub](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine).
