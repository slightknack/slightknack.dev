I occasionally do art or design work, and I thought it would be fun to have a little gallery showcasing some of the work I've done. Currently, there's one poster-style thing I made about other languages spoken in countries that predominately speak Spanish (in Spanish), but I plan to add some watercolor I've done or sketchnotes I've taken as well.
