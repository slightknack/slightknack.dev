# So, what have you worked on?

That's a good question! Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:

-   [**Passerine**](https://www.passerine.io) is a small extensible programming language designed for concise expression with little code. [Take a look at the implementation on GitHub.](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine)
-   [**Keikan (警官)**](https://github.com/slightknack/keikan) is an elegant rendering engine written in Rust. It supports ray-marching and path-tracing.
-   [**Solidarity**](https://github.com/sldty) is a distributed platform built for communication and collaboration. (Currently a work in progress. The backend datastore, [Kitbag, can be found here](https://github.com/sldty/kitbag).)
-   [**Shadergarden**](https://blog.tonari.no/shadergarden) is a tool for creating art with shaders, using GLSL and live-reloaded lisp. It's one of the tools I worked on during my internship at [Tonari](https://tonari.no).
