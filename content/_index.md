# An Introduction

Hello, How are you doing? Welcome to my cozy little corner of the web.

I'm Isaac Clayton, an aspiring Software Architect interested in Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming.

I was born in Provo, Utah in 2004, but have lived around the world. Ever since a young age, I've been interested in the tools we've used to build our modern technological reality.

What I find more incredible than the _stuff_ we've created is _how_ we've created it. Pulling back the layers drives my insatiate curiosity, and I hope to use this website to document what I've come to know.

By the way: I went all out for this page, but I promise the rest of this website is more sane.

# So, what have you worked on?

That's a good question! Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:

-   [**Passerine**](https://www.passerine.io) is a small extensible programming language designed for concise expression with little code. [Take a look at the implementation on GitHub.](https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine)
-   [**Keikan (警官)**](https://github.com/slightknack/keikan) is an elegant rendering engine written in Rust. It supports ray-marching and path-tracing.
-   [**Solidarity**](https://github.com/sldty) is a distributed platform built for communication and collaboration. (Currently a work in progress. The backend datastore, [Kitbag, can be found here](https://github.com/sldty/kitbag).)
-   [**Shadergarden**](https://blog.tonari.no/shadergarden) is a tool for creating art with shaders, using GLSL and live-reloaded lisp. It's one of the tools I worked on during my internship at [Tonari](https://tonari.no).
