    <h1>Isaac Clayton's Website</h1>
<p><strong>Hello, How are you doing? I'm Isaac Clayton, an aspiring Software Architect interested in Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming.</strong></p>

<h2>Past Work and Projects</h2><p>I have a few projects I've been working on up on <a href="https://github.com/slightknack" data-bcup-haslogintext="no">my GitHub</a>.</p><p>If you'd like to discuss working on a project together, please reach out to me. I'm open to working on any open-source projects that align with my interests and explore something new.</p><h2>Say Hello ðŸ‘‹</h2>
<p>You can find me just about anywhere online under the username <code>slightknack</code>, largely because the namespace of memorable usernames across major platforms has become quite small. </p>
<p>I'd love to chat with you about any topic <em>du-jour</em>. I'm not hard to reach, <a href="mailto:hello@slightknack.dev" data-bcup-haslogintext="no">so why not say hello ðŸ“¨</a>?</p>





<h2>I'll see you around!</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading this far, Have a nice day!</p>
