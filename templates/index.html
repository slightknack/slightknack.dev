    <h1>An Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, How are you doing? Welcome to my cozy little corner of the web.</p>

    <p>I'm Isaac Clayton, an aspiring Software Architect interested in Reinforcement Learning, Programming Language Design, and Graphics Programming.</p>
    <p>I was born in Provo, Utah, in 2004, but have lived around the world. Ever since a young age, I've been interested in the tools we've used to build our modern technological reality.</p>
    <p>What I find more incredible than the <em>stuff</em> we've created is <em>how</em> we've created it. Pulling back the layers drives my insatiate curiosity, and I hope to use this website to document what I've come to know.</p>
    <p>By the way: I went all out for this page, but I promise the rest of this website is more sane.</p>

    <p class="tag">Right, hello, perfect! Now that that third-person introduction is out of the way, I think it's appropriate to introduce myself in the first:</p>

    <h1>So, what have you worked on?</h1>
    <p>That's a good question! Here are a few projects I'm particularly proud of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.passerine.io"><strong>Passerine</strong></a> is a small extensible programming language designed for concise expression with little code. <a href="https://github.com/vrtbl/passerine"> Take a look at the implementation on GitHub.</a></p>

    <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/slightknack/keikan"><strong>Keikan (è­¦å®˜)</strong></a> is an elegant rendering engine written in Rust. It supports ray-marching and path-tracing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/solidarity-browser"><strong>Solidarity</strong></a> is a distributed platform built for communication and collaboration. (Currently a work in progress. The backend datastore, <a href="https://github.com/solidarity-browser/kitbag">Kitbag, can be found here</a>.)</p>
